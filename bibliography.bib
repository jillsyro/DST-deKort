  abstract = "Summary 1 Global change and emerging concepts in ecology and
              evolution are leading to a growing interest in phenotypic
              plasticity (PP), the environmentally contingent trait expression
              observed in a given genotype. The need to quantify PP in a simple
              manner in comparative ecological studies has resulted in the
              prevalence of various indices instead of the classic approaches,
              i.e. a comparison of slopes in the norms of reactions (trait vs.
              environment plots). 2 The objectives of this study were: (i) to
              review the most common methods for quantitative estimation of PP;
              (ii) to apply them to a specific case study of growth and
              shoot?root allocation responses to irradiance in seedlings of
              four woody species grown at 1\%, 6\%, 20\% and 100\% full
              sunlight; and (iii) to propose new methods of estimating PP. 3
              The 17 different plasticity indices analysed rendered disparate
              results, with cross-overs in species PP rankings. Statistical
              comparisons of PP among species were not possible with most of
              the indices due to the lack of confidence intervals. The
              non-linear responses of the traits made the use of the slope of
              the reaction norm to quantify PP unrealistic, and raised
              awareness on values derived from studies that consider just two
              environments. 4 We propose an alternative approach to quantify PP
              based on phenotypic distances among individuals of a given
              species exposed to different environments, which is summarized in
              a relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) that allows for
              statistical comparisons of PP between species (or populations
              within species). RDPI was significantly correlated with 12 out of
              the 17 PP indices analysed. An index including the environmental
              range leading to the different phenotypes (environmentally
              standardized plasticity index, ESPI), and thus expressing
              plasticity per unit of environmental change, is also proposed. 5
              The new indexes can statistically segregate and unambiguously
              rank species according to their PP, which can foster a better
              understanding of plant ecology and evolution, particularly when
              common protocols are used by different investigators.",

  abstract = "Abstract Climate change will increase the level of drought stress
              experienced by plant communities, but the spatial distribution of
              projected changes in dryness remains highly uncertain. Species
              can, to some extent, deal with climate uncertainty through
              natural variation in adaptive responses to environmental
              heterogeneity and predictability. Biodiversity conservation could
              thus target populations pre-adapted to climatic heterogeneity to
              anticipate climate uncertainty. Disentangling adaptive evolution
              of trait means versus trait plasticity, however, requires a
              sampling design with genetic replicates grown under distinct
              environmental conditions. Here, we applied three soil moisture
              treatments to genetic replicates of Fragaria vesca plants raised
              from seeds that were sampled in distinct topographical settings,
              to study adaptive trait and plasticity divergence in response to
              drought. We demonstrate that various plant traits evolved along
              distinct topographical gradients. Populations on south-exposed
              slopes, for example, retained high levels of both flowering and
              runner formation under drought stress, while north-faced
              populations hardly flowered under reduced soil moisture levels.
              Aspect but not elevation was found to coincide with variation in
              plant traits, suggesting that microenvironmental variation rather
              than general clines in elevation drive evolution in mountainous
              landscapes. Our results also indicate that traits and their
              plasticity can evolve independently in response to distinct
              topographical stressors. Synthesis. We conclude that
              heterogeneous landscapes (a) harbour micro-refugia of adaptive
              genetic diversity that protect natural populations against
              environmental change, and (b) represent invaluable sources of
              quantitative genetic variation that could support conservation
              where climate projections are inconclusive.",
